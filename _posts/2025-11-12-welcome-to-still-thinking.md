I’m currently a Ph.D. student in pharmacy, approaching the end of my doctoral journey — a phase that feels both conclusive and uncertain. Finishing a Ph.D. doesn’t really mean finding all the answers; if anything, it often opens up more questions about where to go next.

This blog, *Still Thinking*, is a small space I built to slow down and collect my thoughts — about science, AI, biology, creativity, and the long trail of questions that keep me curious. 

There’s no fixed direction here, just an honest attempt to keep thinking — to stay open, reflective, and uncertain in a good way.  
Because for now, and maybe always, I’m still thinking.
